# DX-BALL-GAME
This is my first project using iGraphics in C++, based on the classic game DX-Ball. In this fun game, you control a paddle to bounce a ball and break bricks. You can collect various power-upsâ€”some boost your gameplay, others make it harder. Each level adds more excitement and challenge.
